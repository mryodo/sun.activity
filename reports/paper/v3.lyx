Kuramoto-Model Coupling Reconstruction Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
General scope of the reconstruction procedure and used notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part of the current paper we provide the description of Kuramoto
 model, notation for used variables and general description of inverse problem
 for Kuramoto model being studied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider two oscillators with frequiences 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

 respectively; let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\frac{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

 be their sychronised common frequency, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
\omega_{1} & =\Omega+\Delta\omega\\
\omega_{2} & =\Omega-\Delta\omega
\end{cases},
\]

\end_inset

where we denote symmetrical frequency difference as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

.
 In order to describe the evolution of their phases 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}(t)$
\end_inset

 we propose following diffrential equations(let us denote the coupling function
 of oscillators as 
\begin_inset Formula $k=k(t)$
\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
\dot{\theta}_{1}=\omega_{1}+\frac{k(t)}{2}\sin\left(\theta_{2}(t)-\theta_{1}(t)\right)\\
\dot{\theta}_{2}=\omega_{2}+\frac{k(t)}{2}\sin\left(\theta_{1}(t)-\theta_{2}(t)\right)
\end{cases},
\]

\end_inset

which could be easily transformed by summing and substracting equations
 above into the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
\dot{\theta}_{1}+\dot{\theta}_{2}=2\Omega\\
\dot{\theta}_{1}-\dot{\theta}_{2}=2\Delta\omega-k(t)\sin\left(\theta_{1}(t)-\theta_{2}(t)\right)
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denoting 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\theta}=2\Delta\omega-k(t)\sin\theta(t)\label{eq:kur1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Solving equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:kur1"

\end_inset

, the evolution of phaze difference can be obtained (assuming the first
 equation of the system is easily solvable); this states the direct problem
 in Kuramoto model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our paper focuses on the 
\emph on
inverse
\emph default
 problem: considering that the coupling 
\begin_inset Formula $k(t)$
\end_inset

 is generally unknown, let us assume that its approximation 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 can be obtained from the real data (the whole procedure of its extraction
 and neccesary assumptions are discussed in the third part of the paper).
 Then by solving equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:kur1"

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=k_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 we get the approximation of phaze difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

; this can be use to construct two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

virtual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 oscillators with given phaze difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 (assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}(t)=\Omega t+\theta_{0}(t)/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}(t)=\Omega t-\theta(t)/2$
\end_inset

 ):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
X_{0}(t)=\sin\left(\theta_{1}(t)\right)\\
Y_{0}(t)=\sin\left(\theta_{2}(t)\right)
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Note that proposed virtual oscillators imply that amplitudes of both oscillators
 are the same; moreover let us compute the sliding correlation 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 over a window of common period of oscillators 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\frac{2\pi}{\Omega}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
C_{0}(t) & =C_{T}(X_{0},Y_{0})=\label{eq:slide}\\
 & =\frac{\int_{t-T/2}^{t+T/2}\left(X_{0}(\tau)-\left\langle X_{0}(\tau)\right\rangle _{T}\right)\left(Y_{0}(\tau)-\left\langle Y_{0}(\tau)\right\rangle _{T}\right)d\tau}{\sqrt{\int_{t-T/2}^{t+T/2}\left(X_{0}(\tau)-\left\langle X_{0}(\tau)\right\rangle _{T}\right)^{2}d\tau\int_{t-T/2}^{t+T/2}\left(Y_{0}(\tau)-\left\langle Y_{0}(\tau)\right\rangle _{T}\right)^{2}d\tau}},\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

where by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle X_{0}(\tau)\right\rangle _{T}$
\end_inset

 we denote the mean value of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 over used window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main assumption of overseen reconstruction procedure states that the
 system is close to its stationary state; in which case the sliding correlation
 between oscillators can be computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}(t)=\cos C_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote reconstructed phaze difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi(t)$
\end_inset

 can be obtained using 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 computed by eqaution 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:slide"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi(t)=\arccos C_{0}(t)
\]

\end_inset

Using that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}\approx0$
\end_inset

 one could substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 in the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:kur1"

\end_inset

 and find reconstructed coupling 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}(t)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{k}(t)=\frac{2\Delta\omega}{\sin\varphi(t)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that described procedure is proved to be correct in case
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|k_{0}(t)\right|\ge2\Delta\omega\label{eq:ineq}

Model functions and reconstruction

\begin_layout Standard
In this part of our research we investigate the proposed reconstruction
 procedure from qualitative and quantitative (we describe used metrics further)
 points of view for 4 different sets of coupling approxiamtions 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

: piecewise-constant, sine, autoregressive approximations and its combination;
 focusing on the case of temporarily breaking the synchronization inequality

\begin_layout Subsection
Piecewise-constant approximations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 can be described as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{0}(t)=\begin{cases}
d, & t<T_{0}\lor t>T_{0}+s\\
d+\Delta d, & T_{0}\le t\le T_{0}+s
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta d$
\end_inset

 can be either positive or negative; we refer to the period of the second
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $d+\Delta d$
\end_inset

 as the shock period.

\begin_layout Standard
Figures (1aâ€“c) illustrate results of reconstruction of single approximation
 in three different cases: without breaking the synchronization inequality
 (1a); breaking Kuramoto inequality with resulting additional extremum appearanc
e after the shock period (1b); and breaking Kuramoto inequality with resulting
 appearance of singularity in reconstructed function (1c).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of (1a) it can be seen that the system relaxes to the shocked value
 during the shock period and to the normal value after the shock significant
 amount of time (measured in common periods of oscillators); thus one can
 say that the system has a noticeable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As for the effects of breaking the synchronization inequality (among cases
 in which the shock period is not long enough to create qualitatively new
 figures) we outline two different scenarious: if the shock period is long
 enough (consider figures (1dâ€“e) in order to established the appropriate
 length) reconstructed function tends to begin a relaxation to the normal
 value even before the shock period is over thus creating the second extremum
 after the shock; in case when the system has enough time to fully relax
 to the normal value during the shock, the reconstruction process results
 into the singularity in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}(t)$
\end_inset

 (specifically this means that in that moment of time oscillators are fully
 uncorrelated).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the further investigation of this phenomena we provide figures (1dâ€“e)
 devoted to establishing the length of the shock period 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

 sufficient for the second extremum and singularity; to give more sophisticated
 picture we study cases of low coupling (low 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, comparatively to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

) (fig.
 1d) and high coupling (fig.
 1e).
 As shown increasing (and therefore strengthing the breaking difference
 in the inequality) symmetrical phaze difference results into earlier appearance
 of both effects and shorter time interval between the second extremum appearanc
e and the singularity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sine approximations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part we propose coupling approximation as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{0}(t)=A\sin\left(Bt+\varepsilon\right)+C,
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is an amplitude, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a frequency and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is a mean value.
 Moreover, unless stated otherwise, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $C-A<2\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

, so we study mainly the case of inequality breaking.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Same as for piecewise-constant case, figures (2aâ€“c) illustrate results of
 reconstruction of single approximation; for those pictures we vary the
 frequency of sine being reconstructed.
 Figure (2a) shows the case for correct reconstruction despite the inequality
 breaking; similar to the piecewise-constant case (fig.
 (1b)) we observe gradual relaxation to values restricted by inequality
 with noticeable flattening.
 Figures (2b) and (2c) shows two opposite cases of poor recontruction quality:
 for the figure (2b) it can be seen that more frequent fluctuation are less
 appropriate for the reconstruction which can be explained by an absense
 of sufficient time for relaxation as seen on fig.
 (1) and (2a); figure (2c) demonstates the case of singularity achieved
 by the same condition as on fig.
 (1c) â€” too long restricted value period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures (2dâ€“e) generalize the study of reconstruction towards approximation's
 sine frequency; to measure the quality of the process we propose the following
 metric:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{0}[\hat{k},k_{0}]=\frac{\int_{0}^{L}\left(k_{0}(t)-\left\langle k_{0}(t)\right\rangle _{L}\right)\left(\hat{k}(t)-\left\langle \hat{k}(t)\right\rangle _{L}\right)dt}{\int_{0}^{L}k_{0}^{2}(t)dt}
\]

\end_inset

(in assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0;L]$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 denotes the end of time interval being studied).
 Figure (2d) illustrates the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $C-A>2\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

; thus general increase of error corresponds with phenomenon observed on
 fig.
 (2b).
 Figure (2e) explores the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $C-A<2\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

 (in log scale): here we can see three different parts â€” the first one correspon
ds to the case of no breaking (such as fig.
 (2d)), then we obtain highly unreconstructed part corresponding to fig.
 (2c) associated with singularities and finally we get similar to fig.
 (2d) plot explained by increase of sine frequency.

\begin_layout Subsection
Autoregressive ramdom approximations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simulate the random noise for our procedure we study autoregressive
 process (AR(1)), which can be described as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{0}(t_{n})=\alpha k_{0}(t_{n-1})+\xi_{n},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\alpha<1$

 This stochastic process is widely on as weakly stationary after 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}$
\end_inset

 with the mean equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\mu}{1-\alpha}$

\begin_layout Standard
One realization of described process and its reconstruction are shown on
 figure (3a); more precisely, in that case we obtain the general understanding
 of reconstruction as smoothing highly variable approximations; furthermore
 it can be seen that for the time interval in around 
\begin_inset Formula $t\approx15$
\end_inset

 we get poor reconstruction quality explained by rapid change of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 as for too frequent sine series as in fig.
 (2b); for the time interval in around 
\begin_inset Formula $t\approx20$
\end_inset

 we get a correct reconstruction with flattening similar to fig.
 (2a); the time interval for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\approx32$
\end_inset

 illustrates the occurence of singularity with the same reasoning as for
 piecewise-constant and sine cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the stochasticity of the process one should assume that for
 every set of parameters all seen for previous functions cases of reconstruction
 are possible with some probability.
 Thus we vary 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 on figure (3bâ€“c) in order to get the probability of singularity in each
 case (the mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=2\Delta\omega+K\sigma$
\end_inset

 is varied through 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

).
 As shown on figure (3b) it can be concluded that the probability of obtainig
 singularity through the reconstruction declines with the mean growth which
 can be explained by the fact that with the mean growth expected values
 of the stochastic process are more distant from 
\begin_inset Formula $2\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

 with fixed variance; thus prolonged restricted values of the process are
 less likely.
 Another trend of figure (3b) is general growth of singularity probability
 towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

; specifically, as shown in figure (3c) in 
\begin_inset Formula $\log X\sim\log\log Y$
\end_inset

 scale, it is linear with regression coefficient equal to 1 (with non-distinctiv
e fluctuations).
 One should notice that whilst being linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\log X\sim\log\log Y$
\end_inset

 scale, given plot is not linear in simpler 
\begin_inset Formula $X\sim\log Y$
\end_inset

 scale; it can be explained by the presense of pre-exponential functional
 factor 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\alpha)$
\end_inset

 that gets close to constant only in 
\begin_inset Formula $\log X\sim\log\log Y$
\end_inset

 scale.

\begin_layout Standard
In this scope for given problem the main question one should answer is how
 influential the additive autoregression process is; in other words we should
 establish the confidence interval associated with random noise for reconstructe
d function 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}(t)$
\end_inset

; let us denote the width of the confidence interval as 
\begin_inset Formula $e(t)$
\end_inset

.
 For figures (4a,c) we determine 95% confidence interval for each moment
 of time (note that there is no given knowledge about the distribution);
 also we provide de-noised 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}^{clear}(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}^{clear}(t)$
\end_inset

 in orde to illustrate centers of confidence interval and describe overall
 reconstruction error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures (4aâ€“b) demonstrates the case of varying 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

in additive noise; for each case figure (4b) shows the corresponding plot
 
\begin_inset Formula $e(t)/\left(\sigma\cdot k_{0}^{clear}(t)\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore it can be concluded that the width of confidence interval is
 proportional to the noise's variance; in the same time plots discrepancies
 correspond to lower phazes of the de-noised sine series where as seen on
 fig.
 (3b) the probability of singularity occurence is higher thus making reconstruct
ion mostly incorrect and more variable.
 Figures (4câ€“d) compiled similarly to figures (4aâ€“b); note that in this
 case we vary the Kuramoto inequality threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

 and since figure (4c) does not demonstrate any difference in confidence
 intreval's widths towards the threshold, we use only 
\begin_inset Formula $e(t)/k_{0}^{clear}(t)$
\end_inset

 for figure (4d).
 Note that the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\omega=0.15$
\end_inset

, which implies not only random breaking of the synchronization inequality
 but also systematical breaking as shown on figure (4c) with yellow dashed
 line, noticeably differs from the others; despite the fact that it is seemingly
 more probable case for singularity occurence, the plot is lower than the
 others which can be explained by the fact that not only we obtain singularity
 and incorrect reconstrucions but we also obtain correct ones with flattening
 (as discussed earlier) to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\Delta\omega$
\end_inset

 thus making reconstructed function less variable resulting in more narrow
 confidence interval.
